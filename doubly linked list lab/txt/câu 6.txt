In this exercise, we will use Standard Template Library List (click open in other tab to show more) to implement a Data Log. 

This is a simple implementation in applications using undo and redo. For example in Microsoft Word, you must have nodes to store states when Ctrl Z or Ctrl Shift Z to go back or forward.

DataLog has a doubly linked list to store the states of data (an integer) and iterator to mark the current state. Each state is stored in a node, the transition of states is depicted in the figure below. 

Your task in this exercise is implement functions marked with /*  * TODO   */.


class DataLog
{
private:
    list<int> logList;
    list<int>::iterator currentState;

public:
    DataLog();
    DataLog(const int &data);
    void addCurrentState(int number);
    void subtractCurrentState(int number);
    void save();
    void undo();
    void redo();

    int getCurrentStateData()
    {
        return *currentState;
    }
    
    void printLog()
    {      
        for (auto i = logList.begin(); i != logList.end(); i++) {
            if(i == currentState) cout << "Current state: ";
            cout << "[ " << *i << " ] => ";
        }
        cout << "END_LOG";
    }
};
Note: Normally, when we say a List, we talk about doubly linked list. For implementing a singly linked list, we use forward list.

We have include <iostream> <list> and using namespace std;
