Class LLNode representing a node of singly linked lists is declared as below:
class LLNode {
public:
    int val;
    LLNode* next;
    LLNode(); // Constructor: val = 0, next = nullptr
    LLNode(int val, LLNode* next); // Constructor with customized data
}
Given a singly linked list head node.
Your task is to implement a function with following prototype:
LLNode* reverseLinkedList(LLNode* head);
The function returns head node of the reversed singly linked list.

Note:
- The iostream library has been included and namespace std is being used. No other libraries are allowed.
- The constructors and methods of class LLNode have been defined fully so you do not need to redefine them.
- You can write helper functions.

For example:
