Class LLNode is used to store a node in a singly linked list, described on the following:

class LLNode {
    public:
        int val;
        LLNode* next;
        LLNode();
        LLNode(int val, LLNode* next);
}
Where val is the value of node, next is the pointer to the next node.

Request: Implement function:

LLNode* addLinkedList(LLNode* l0, LLNode* l1);
Where l0, l1 are two linked lists represented positive integers, each node is a digit, the head is the least significant digit (the value of each node is between 0 and 9, the length of each linked list is between 0 and 100000). This function returns the linked list representing the sum of the two integers.

Example:

Given l0 = [2, 3] (representing 32) and l1 = [1, 8] (representing 81). The result would be l0 = [3, 1, 1] (representing 32 + 81 = 113).

Note:

In this exercise, the libraries iostream, string, cstring, climits, utility, vector, list, stack, queue, map, unordered_map, set, unordered_set, functional, algorithm has been included and namespace std are used. You can write helper functions and classes. Importing other libraries is allowed, but not encouraged, and may result in unexpected errors.
